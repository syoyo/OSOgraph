OSOgraph
========

OSOgraph visualizes OSO(compiled intermediate instructions of OpenShadingLanguage by oslc) using graphviz.

Requirements
------------

 * OSL compiler from openshadinglanguage
   * http://code.google.com/p/openshadinglanguage/
 * Python


How to use
----------

::

 $ oslc input.osl
 $ python osograph.py input.oso
 $ graphviz 


Limitation & TODO
-----------------

A lot.

I've made this simple script just for fun and understanding oso format, thus please don't expect too much on this project ;-)
